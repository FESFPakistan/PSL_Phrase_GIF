# PSL_Phrase_GIF
a simple JS page which shows GIFs in a sentence

I took all videos from psl.org.pk, created GIFs of the videos, cropped the GIFs to only show the signer(person), compressed, reencoded to decrease size of GIFs and put all in gifs folder and wrote this HTML file.

put GIFs in a gifs folder beside idnex.html file, any gif with matching name (plus _onlysign.gif) in its name will be shown
